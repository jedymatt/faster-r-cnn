# Faster R-CNN

Setup using Anaconda or Miniconda environment

```bash
# install dependencies
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow
```

If you don't have anaconda or miniconda you can use pip instead with venv as the environment

```bash
# setup venv
python -m venv .venv
# install dependencies
pip install jupyterlab
pip install tensorflow
```

Run either jupyterlab or notebook

```bash
jupyter-lab 
# or
# jupyter notebook
```

You can also use vscode with [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extension installed instead of jupyter-lab or notebook
